Assignment 3
Readme

In this assignment, I have implemented a parser using Ocamlyacc, which deals with expressions followed by a semicolon and newline. 
The expression is of type (index assign func x) where x can be (range float), (range range), etc
For checking, the OCaml functions (to be implemented in next assignment) are printed on the console

I have referred the following link for the syntax:

Changes to assignment 2:
1. I had implemented Range as (I,I) by mistake, corrected it to (I:I)
2. Removed the definition of tokens, printing of tokens from lex and shifted the definition of tokens to yacc.
